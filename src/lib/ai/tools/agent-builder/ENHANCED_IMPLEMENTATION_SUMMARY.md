// Access detailed results
console.log('Quality Score:', result.qualityMetrics.overallScore);
console.log('Validation Results:', result.validationSummary);
console.log('Generated Components:', result.components);
```

### Individual Step Usage
```typescript
// Use individual enhanced steps
const promptAnalysis = await executeStep0PromptUnderstanding({
  prompt: "Build a CRM system",
  existingAgent: null
});

const decisions = await executeStep1Decision({
  promptUnderstanding: promptAnalysis,
  existingAgent: null
});

const technicalAnalysis = await executeStep2TechnicalAnalysis({
  promptUnderstanding: promptAnalysis,
  decisions: decisions,
  existingAgent: null
});

const database = await executeStep3DatabaseGeneration({
  promptUnderstanding: promptAnalysis,
  decisions: decisions,
  technicalAnalysis: technicalAnalysis,
  existingAgent: null
});
```
